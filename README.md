# F1-data-analysis-with-R

This is a first attempt at uploading R code that I have learnt over the last months. 

In order to produce the graphics within this, you will first need to download R from here: https://cran.r-project.org/

You will then need to download RStudio, which is excellent for producing these graphics, from here: https://www.rstudio.com/

Once you have these, you're almost ready to produce the graphics. You will need to first install and then load in the packages.

Once you've done that, you're free to start practising R!
